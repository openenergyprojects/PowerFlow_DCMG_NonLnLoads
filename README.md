# PowerFlow_DCMG_NonLnLoads
Power Flow (PF) model for a simplified DC microgrid cluster with nonlinear and non-constant power load models. 

The models for the loads were derived from actual lab measurements made in steady state conditions varing the voltage level at the power supply side of teh devices.
Details of the model, and how the load models were derived are given in this paper: "Power flow formulation for LVDC microgrids with nonlinear load models".
